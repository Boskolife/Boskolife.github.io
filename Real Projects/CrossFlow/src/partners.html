                                        Trade Finance has existed in one form or another for almost as long as trade in
                                        volume has existed – with forms of
                                        discounting being recorded as being in use in Mesopotamia (broadly aligning to
                                        modern day Iraq, Syria and Kuwait).
                                        Supply Chain Finance is a more modern form of financing which was first
                                        introduced
                                        into the marketplace in the 1980s,
                                        with the first use of the term being recorded in a 1982 interview in the
                                        Financial
                                        Times.

                                        What is Supply Chain Finance?
                                    </h2>
                                    <p class="block-description">
                                        The terminology around Supply Chain Finance often varies, but at Crossflow we
                                        provide the expertise and infrastructure
                                        to deliver Seller-led Working Capital Finance programmes. In practice this means
                                        that the finance is offered to the
                                        Seller of the goods once the invoice has been accepted and approved – creating
                                        an
                                        obligation to settle the invoice upon
                                        the Buyer who would typically be a large Corporate or Multi-National Company.
                                        The
                                        provider of finance (the Funder)
                                        receives an Assignment of the right to the payment from the Corporate for that
                                        invoice in return for a small discount
                                        which is agreed by the Seller. The Funder receives payment for the full value of
                                        the
                                        invoice from the Buyer on the date
                                        the invoice was originally due to be paid to the Seller. In short, the Funder
                                        offers
                                        to buy the right to the entire
                                        payment due to the Seller for a discount.

                                        Whilst from a cash perspective the Funder is providing liquidity directly to the

                                        hence credit risk, is against the Buyer. From a Funder perspective, Working

                                Supply Chain Finance is attractive to Corporates primarily because it enables them to
                                maintain their own working capital
                                for longer periods without damaging their supply chain by withdrawing liquidity.
                                Seller-led Working Capital Finance
                                programmes can often be represented on the balance sheet as Accounts Payable obligations
                                (because the arrangement is
                                cash neutral for the Buyer), as opposed to other forms of financing which may impact
                                leve

                                Suppliers will often have access to a variety of ways to fund their business, but these
                                may be less transparent or only
                                available on punitive terms. It may also be the case that the Supplier is smaller or
                                perceived to be a greater credit
                                risk than the Buyer, and so a Working Capital Finance programme enables a Supplier to
                                access funding whilst benefiting
                                from pricing closer to that which may be offered to a larger, better rated entity.

                                        Working Capital Finance programmes are operated on a bilateral basis which means
