                                    Investor’s Virtual Account confirms that the User wishes to use
                                    the i-Platform and the services offered therein pursuant to the
                                    Agreement provisions.</p>
                                <p>3.6. When registering and logging into (entering) the User’s

                                    User must keep the User’s password in a secure manner, as well
                                    as regularly, however not less frequently than once every 6
                                    (six) months or at other frequency required by Cash Trinity,
                                    change/update the password. Cash Trinity may impose rules on how
                                    passwords may be created, like the minimum amount of symbols,
                                    that it must contain at least 1 (one) capital and 1 (one) lower
                                    case letter, and/or any other rules at it shall find reasonably
                                    necessary.</p>
                                <p> 3.9. If the User’s password has become known or may have become
                                    known to a third party, the User must immediately inform Cash
                                    Trinity about it in writing or over the telephone, at which time
                                    Cash Trinity shall block access to the User’s Profile as soon as
                                    possible, until, on the grounds of the User’s application, the
                                    User is given a new User’s password and the User has given an
                                    instruction to Cash Trinity to unblock the User’s Profile.</p>
                                <p> 3.10. Access to the User’s Profile is temporarily blocked, if
                                    the User’s password is entered incorrectly 5 (five) times in a
                                    row.</p>
                                <p> 3.11. Cash Trinity is entitled to, however is not obliged to,
                                    block access to the User’s Profile if Cash Trinity suspects that

                                    including, if Cash Trinity suspects that the User’s password has
                                    become known or may have become known to a third party, if Cash
                                    Trinity has suspicions of the execution of illegal transactions,
                                    as well as in other cases at the discretion of Cash Trinity, in
                                    order to ensure safety of services, inviolability,

                                    the clients.</p>
                                <p>3.12. Cash Trinity shall be entitled not to approve a transaction
                                    and/or not to execute any application or instruction given by
                                    the User and not to provide Services to the User, if:</p>
                                <p>3.12.1 the User fails to comply with the Terms and Conditions;
                                </p>
                                <p>3.12.2 Cash Trinity has suspicions about the identity of the
                                    User, and Cash Trinity has not been able to contact the User to
