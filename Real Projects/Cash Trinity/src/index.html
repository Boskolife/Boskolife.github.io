                                            Private lending has been a reliable way of generating
                                            profits and cash flow for literally centuries. We have
                                            records of private lending agreements as early as 3,000
                                            B.C., showing people loaning to others for defined time
                                            periods in exchange for “interest” paid in wheat,
                                            livestock, shekels of silver, or other commodities.
                                            Interest rates of 20% – 40% were common in ancient
                                            times, though extraordinarily high rates became known as
                                            “usury” and became discouraged or outlawed.

                                            When you invest in the stock market, you are placing a
                                            bet that the price will go up. Historically, this may be
                                            true often. Yet we can observe times when this has gone
                                            horribly wrong!
                                            When you loan money as a private lender, you have an
                                            agreement that specifies how much you’ll be paid and
                                            when. Properly constructed with protections and the
                                            right borrower, this delivers very predictable returns,
                                            such as payments that come in like clockwork.
                                            The exception? If your private lending deal is not
                                            properly constructed or vetted, there is a chance of
                                            loss. That does not necessarily mean that you’ll lose
                                            your capital, but in cases where the borrower was paying
                                            you directly, a property could have to be foreclosed on
                                            and then sold to get your cash out of the property.

                                            lenders are some of the most profitable businesses in
                                            the world. Unfortunately, many people tend to be
                                            borrowers, not lenders! So, if you’ve got money to lend,
                                            congratulations, you can put it to good use.
                                            In this low-interest environment, you can earn several

                                            unpredictability of the stock market or crypto. And if
                                            interest rates at banks go up, so will interest rates
                                            for private lenders! That’s because there will always be
                                            people who need to borrow money outside of mainstream
                                            channels.

                                            You can also leave the interest you earn with CashTriniti, to further generate your wealth. It’s called compound interest. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has called compound interest an investor’s best friend because it grows at a faster rate than simple interest since it earns returns not only on your initial investment but on the interest you accumulate as well. And the longer your money has to grow, the more interest it can earn.
