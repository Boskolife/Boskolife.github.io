                                    change/update the password. Cash Trinity may impose rules on how
                                    passwords may be created, like the minimum amount of symbols,

                                    known to a third party, the User must immediately inform Cash
                                    Trinity about it in writing or over the telephone, at which time
                                    Cash Trinity shall block access to the User’s Profile as soon as
                                    possible, until, on the grounds of the User’s application, the
                                    User is given a new User’s password and the User has given an
                                    instruction to Cash Trinity to unblock the User’s Profile.</p>
                                <p> 3.10. Access to the User’s Profile is temporarily blocked, if

                                    including, if Cash Trinity suspects that the User’s password has
                                    become known or may have become known to a third party, if Cash
                                    Trinity has suspicions of the execution of illegal transactions,
                                    as well as in other cases at the discretion of Cash Trinity, in
                                    order to ensure safety of services, inviolability,
                                    confidentiality of the User and/or other Cash Trinity clients or
                                    to prevent losses that might be inflicted upon Cash Trinity or
                                    the clients.</p>

                                    the User and not to provide Services to the User, if:</p>
                                <p>3.12.1 the User fails to comply with the Terms and Conditions;
                                </p>
                                <p>3.12.2 Cash Trinity has suspicions about the identity of the
