                                    procedures established in the Terms and Conditions and

                                <p> 3.8. The User’s password is deemed confidential information that
                                    the User and Cash Trinity undertake not to disclose and shall
                                    undertake to prevent that third parties can find it out. The
                                    User must keep the User’s password in a secure manner, as well
                                    as regularly, however not less frequently than once every 6
                                    (six) months or at other frequency required by Cash Trinity,
                                    change/update the password. Cash Trinity may impose rules on how
                                    passwords may be created, like the minimum amount of symbols,

                                <p> 3.9. If the User’s password has become known or may have become
                                    known to a third party, the User must immediately inform Cash
                                    Trinity about it in writing or over the telephone, at which time
                                    Cash Trinity shall block access to the User’s Profile as soon as
                                    possible, until, on the grounds of the User’s application, the
                                    User is given a new User’s password and the User has given an
                                    instruction to Cash Trinity to unblock the User’s Profile.</p>
                                <p> 3.10. Access to the User’s Profile is temporarily blocked, if
                                    the User’s password is entered incorrectly 5 (five) times in a
                                    row.</p>

                                    including, if Cash Trinity suspects that the User’s password has
                                    become known or may have become known to a third party, if Cash
                                    Trinity has suspicions of the execution of illegal transactions,

                                    all

                                    circumstances have been prevented, the Party must immediately
                                    resume
                                    the performance of its duties.
