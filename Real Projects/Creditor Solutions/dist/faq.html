                                <h4 class="tab_title">How does Creditor Solutions recover my judgment award?</h4>
                                <p class="tab_content">A judgment submitted for enforcement begins its journey in the onboarding department. There, an onboarding agent evaluates the claim, determines its suitability for enforcement and generates a request for background information from numerous sources, including the awarding court, the county clerk and even the judgment creditor. Once established, the judgment is then transported to our investigations department, where it is matched with an agent. It is there that a skilled investigator constructs a thorough profile of the debtor. Add a line where we identify the correct person using the best tools in the industry that are hard to get approved for along with proprietary technology. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After the debtor profile is completed, the judgment investigator is equipped to begin the pursuit for debtor assets. There are an overwhelming number of tools available to New York State judgment enforcement agencies, like ours, to uncover debtor assets and enforce our clients’ rights. To employ all those tools for each instance would be costly and time consuming. That is why our investigation agents take the time to determine the most appropriate route for recovery, guided by their familiarity with the judgment, the various investigative tools at their disposal and the probability of success using a specific method based on prior similar judgments that have used that method and succeeded.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Each one of our judgment investigators is trained, not only to uncover, but to analyze data related to the debtor and synthesize it for purposes of enforcement. Our agents delve into publicly accessible databases, subpoenaed financial records, property transfer records, social media and proprietary databases, among other sources. Once an enforceable asset is uncovered, our experts take immediate steps for leveraging it for enforcement. That could mean by working closely with the New York City Marshals and New York State Sheriffs offices, or negotiating a settlement with the debtor directly. This process continues until we achieve the result of complete satisfaction of judgment, meaning the judgment is entirely paid. 
                                </p>

                                <p class="tab_content">There is no specific time-frame that we can guarantee, or even that we’ll be able to successfully enforce the judgment on your behalf. Each judgment is unique and requires differing approaches for enforcement, which translates to either longer or shorter recovery periods. Additionally, we rely heavily on the responsiveness of the New York State Courts, which vary considerably. With that in mind, a median range for productive enforcement typically takes between six to twelve months.

                                <p class="tab_content">Using a third-party, like Creditor Solutions, simply allows the judgment a higher chance of recovery. It allows for access to and application of any and all investigations and enforcement tools available in the industry, use of our network of attorneys and law firms, law enforcement agencies and licensed investigation experts. Most importantly, we cover all up-front enforcement costs for our clients and if we don’t succeed, there is no cost for our services.

                                <p class="tab_content">Using Creditor Solutions means including a variety of experts in the recovery process, rather than just one. Creditor Solutions works closely with New York State enforcement attorneys and law firms to provide the missing pieces of the puzzle and assist them in their actions. We utilize a number of law firms specializing in judgment enforcement, arming us with a network of attorneys to provide individualized attention to each of our claims, without any additional cost to you. This assistance is crucial to successfully employing any enforcement strategy.

                                <h4 class="tab_title">What is the likelihood that Creditor Solutions will succeed in enforcing my judgment?</h4>
                                <p class="tab_content">The likelihood that we will be successful in recovery varies . For example, older judgments are harder to enforce because there is a higher likelihood that the debtor, if an individual, has passed away or, if a corporate entity, has dissolved. Other factors that play a part in enforceability include the size of the judgment, whether the debtor has unencumbered assets, whether there are prior unsatisfied judgments against the debtor and whether the debtor resides within the state.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                All of the potential roadblocks will become apparent after we’ve received the application for enforcement and our onboarding agents have conducted a thorough workup. Once the judgment profile is established, an agent will be better able to understand the judgment and let you know how probable a successful outcome may be. With that said, the more information you are able to provide regarding the debtor, such as where the debtor banks, or the debtor's primary customers or clients, the better the chances of recovery.

Under New York law (NY CPLR section 211(b)), the prevailing party is presumed to have been paid in full <i>“after the expiration of 20 years from the time when the party recovering it was first entitled to enforce it.”</i>

                                <p class="tab_content">After a judgment is awarded, the losing party can file an appeal, asking a higher court to review and reverse the decision of a trial court. Although filing an appeal does <b>not</b> stop the trial court’s order, if the trial court’s decision is overturned on appeal, it’s likely that any money paid by the judgment debtor during the appeal will have to be returned. The appeals process is very complicated and inviting a judgment enforcement agency only hinders the process. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                For these reasons, Creditor Solutions does not accept submissions for enforcement of judgment awards currently on appeal or where the judgment debtor has stayed the judgment.

                                <br>
                                On the other hand, the court to which a verdict is appealed <b>only</b> reviews whether a <i>legal</i> mistake was made and whether this mistake changed the final decision in the case. The court only reviews the decision to make sure that the legal processes were executed properly. It cannot change the trial court’s decision just because it may not agree with it. Therefore, appeals do not usually change the trial court’s decision and will be upheld. Once the trial court’s decision is upheld, Creditor Solutions can begin its enforcement!

                                <p class="tab_content">According to the New York Estates, Powers & Trusts Law, creditors have a maximum of seven months from the date the executor is appointed to file any claim against an estate. If a claim is brought after the seven-month period and the executor has distributed assets to the beneficiaries or paid other claims, then the executor is not responsible for the claim if no money is available to pay such claim (SCPA §1802). Although there are certain exceptions to this rule, the process of enforcing a judgment against an estate often proves costly and fruitless. For this reason, unless already handling the enforcement at the time of a judgment debtor’s death, Creditor Solutions will not proceed in an enforcement against the estate of a deceased judgment debtor. </p>
