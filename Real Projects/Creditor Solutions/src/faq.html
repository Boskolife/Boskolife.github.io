                            <p class="tab_content">A judgment submitted for enforcement begins
                                its journey in the onboarding department. There, an onboarding
                                agent evaluates the claim, determines its suitability for
                                enforcement and generates a request for background information
                                from numerous sources, including the awarding court, the county
                                clerk and even the judgment creditor. Once established, the
                                judgment is then transported to our investigations department,
                                where it is matched with an agent. It is there that a skilled
                                investigator constructs a thorough profile of the debtor. Add a
                                line where we identify the correct person using the best tools
                                in the industry that are hard to get approved for along with
                                proprietary technology.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After the debtor profile is completed, the judgment investigator
                                is equipped to begin the pursuit for debtor assets. There are an
                                overwhelming number of tools available to New York State
                                judgment enforcement agencies, like ours, to uncover debtor
                                assets and enforce our clients’ rights. To employ all those
                                tools for each instance would be costly and time consuming. That
                                is why our investigation agents take the time to determine the
                                most appropriate route for recovery, guided by their familiarity
                                with the judgment, the various investigative tools at their
                                disposal and the probability of success using a specific method
                                based on prior similar judgments that have used that method and
                                succeeded.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Each one of our judgment investigators is trained, not only to
                                uncover, but to analyze data related to the debtor and
                                synthesize it for purposes of enforcement. Our agents delve into
                                publicly accessible databases, subpoenaed financial records,
                                property transfer records, social media and proprietary
                                databases, among other sources. Once an enforceable asset is
                                uncovered, our experts take immediate steps for leveraging it
                                for enforcement. That could mean by working closely with the New
                                York City Marshals and New York State Sheriffs offices, or
                                negotiating a settlement with the debtor directly. This process
                                continues until we achieve the result of complete satisfaction
                                of judgment, meaning the judgment is entirely paid.

                                the judgment on your behalf. Each judgment is unique and
                                requires differing approaches for enforcement, which translates
                                to either longer or shorter recovery periods. Additionally, we
                                rely heavily on the responsiveness of the New York State Courts,
                                which vary considerably. With that in mind, a median range for
                                productive enforcement typically takes between six to twelve
                                months.

                                enforce because there is a higher likelihood that the debtor, if
                                an individual, has passed away or, if a corporate entity, has
                                dissolved. Other factors that play a part in enforceability
                                include the size of the judgment, whether the debtor has
                                unencumbered assets, whether there are prior unsatisfied
                                judgments against the debtor and whether the debtor resides

                                On the other hand, the court to which a verdict is appealed
                                <b>only</b> reviews whether a <i>legal</i> mistake was made and
                                whether this mistake changed the final decision in the case. The
                                court only reviews the decision to make sure that the legal
                                processes were executed properly. It cannot change the trial
                                court’s decision just because it may not agree with it.
                                Therefore, appeals do not usually change the trial court’s
                                decision and will be upheld. Once the trial court’s decision is
