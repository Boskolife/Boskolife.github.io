                    <p class="blog-description first-block">For over twenty years, China has experienced an export boom,
                        powering
                        through the early 2000s and
                        overtaking the US as
                        the world’s biggest exporter in 2009. Today, exports stand at a massive USD 2.7 trillion,
                        however things are starting to
                        cool.

                        The impact of Covid on production has been met with reduced global demand amid a cost-of-living
                        crisis. At the same
                        time, rising fuel prices have led to an exponential rise in shipping costs. This is before
                        considering market specific
                        factors such as the Shanghai port blockade and the impact of recent extreme weather.

                            the most experienced Chief Procurement Officer, but
                            is it enough to nudge them towards the unthinkable and begin the process of de-coupling from
                            China?
                            <br>

                            It is certainly up for discussion. Supply chain resiliency is a hot topic and risk
                            mitigation is a crucial element to
                            ensuring a robust flow of business-critical goods. Gone is the risk counterbalance that
                            Chinese trade enabled the flow
                            of low-cost goods into Europe. With ever increasing costs, the concentration risk of single
                            country-of-origin sourcing
                            is weighing on the mind.

                        Of course, it’s not straightforward to onboard a new supplier, let alone source from new
                        markets. There are many
                        considerations to weigh on such a decision. Cost of entry into new markets and establishing new
                        buying relationships
                        requires time and capital. The reality is that perhaps a complete de-coupling is unnecessary,
                        however establishing new
                        sourcing markets may well be prudent.

                        <br>
                        A two-pronged approach to de-risking your supply chain could be advantageous. For example,
                        putting provision in place to
                        switch sourcing to an alternative market in the event of trade restrictions. Leveraging
                        pre-shipment finance would
                        enable diversification to new suppliers enabling them to gear up to source raw materials and
                        fulfil orders without
                        having to raise capital in expensive local markets. In addition, a working capital programme for
                        these and existing
                        suppliers can position a corporate favorably and put them at the front of the queue in the case
                        of shortages
