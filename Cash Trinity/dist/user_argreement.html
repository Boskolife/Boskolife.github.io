                                    known to a third party, the User must immediately inform Cash
                                    Trinity about it in writing or over the telephone, at which time
                                    Cash Trinity shall block access to the User’s Profile as soon as
                                    possible, until, on the grounds of the User’s application, the
                                    User is given a new User’s password and the User has given an
                                    instruction to Cash Trinity to unblock the User’s Profile.</p>
                                <p> 3.10. Access to the User’s Profile is temporarily blocked, if

                                    resume
                                    the performance of its duties.
